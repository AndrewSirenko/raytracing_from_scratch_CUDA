# CUDA Accelerated Raytracing from scratch

Ray tracing is a method of graphics rendering that creates an image by simulating the physical behavior of light in a 3D scene, rather than projecting a 3D mesh of triangles onto a 2D screen with rasterization. This advanced tracking of light allows for the simulation of a variety of optical effects like reflection, refraction, soft shadows, scattering, depth of field, motion blur, caustics, ambient occlusion and dispersion phenomena at little additional cost compared to rasterization-based rendering.
